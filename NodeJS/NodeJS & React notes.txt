An SPA (Single-page application) is a web app implementation that loads only a single web document, and then updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript APIs.

Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a stage in the evolution of application development and/or integration. It defines a way to make software components reusable using the interfaces.

Pseudocode to create a component

create a component subfolder in src folder
create new js file
1] import React, {Hook} from 'react'
2] define your component
3] export your component

Finally, 
import your component in app.js

============================================================

Hooks: (special functions that let you "hook into" React features)
1) usestate - store/retrieve value of particular property (similar to getter and setter methods in java)
2) useEffect - perform side effects in your components. Examples: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.
